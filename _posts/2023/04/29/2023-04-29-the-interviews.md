I recently finished a bunch of interviews. The first interview made me feel nervous, and then I failed. But actually, I retrieve a lot from it. Before the interview, the only thing I planned was "planning to fail" - please don't try this like me. Positively, after listening to the interview questions, I did know that there are things I don't know, and I have to learn and practice them. So I'm starting to learn a few things quickly for the next session. Everything is back on track after the first interview I got

- Two offer letters (I take one of them)
- Two more interview sessions (but canceled)

So, what did I do after the first interview? Well, this is the list
- Review my CV, seasoning with some tech stack
- Reorder my work experience, what is essential should be on top
- Customize CV for every single job
- Googling the answer from the first interview
- Write the script for the English introduction about myself

What did I learn after this?
- How to counter the offer
- The right way to answer HR, recruiters, ...
- More about Kafka, Golang
