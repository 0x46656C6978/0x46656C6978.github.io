## What I’m going to write down?

Technology
Technology will be the main topic of the website. I always want to share my knowledge in presentations, blogs, videos, etc.

## Self-development

On my career path, my goal is to become an expert. I don’t want to stand still while other people keep moving forward. So, this topic will be a place to talk about how and when.

## Projects

As a software engineer, I have to learn a lot and create pet projects, and maybe one of them could be helpful to someone. So I’ll publish it on GitHub and post on this topic.
