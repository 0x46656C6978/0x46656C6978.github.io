Pretty long time since I had to shutdown my homelab because I don't have enough time for it. Back to couple months ago, I running my homelab on my mini PC for testing and it works, but lack of a lot of features (now still). After I finished my deadlines at work, last week I decided to bring back my homelab project. I'm still working on it and will update it later. Now instead of just testing, I acctually used it for hobby projects. The TODO list really, really long, I can write down a bit here:
- Make a setup progress more friendly
- More details on documentation so anyone can use without question
- Add more features to make it like a small cloud provider
- ...

This project will take time to finish and I could learn a lot from it. I hope it will be helpful for others. If you're interested, please take a look in the link below. Always welcome feedbacks!
