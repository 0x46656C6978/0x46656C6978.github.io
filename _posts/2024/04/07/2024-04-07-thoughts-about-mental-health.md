Since I left my job at Xantus in May 2023, I have to facing a lot of pressure, feel that I'm not ready for new opportunities at that time but I need money to stay alive so I can't stop working. In the next 3 months, I applied to 2 companies, and this is when my mental health started to break when deadlines were coming, time was limited and I didn't have good skills to resolve tasks. Next, I applied to the 3rd company, and it was a great experience. But unfortunately, my health wasn't good enough to keep working so I decided to leave. Everything will be done on the next 19 April. Before I decided to quit I did have a plan to do. Here is the next step for me in about 3 months, I think:
- Take a break, travel somewhere with my friends to re-charge
- Sharpen my skills
- Sharing more details about the whole progress since I realized that I have a problem with mental health

Hope you well and see you soon!
